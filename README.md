Branch Name: access-control-security-management

Description:
This branch contains SQL scripts for managing access control and security settings in a database environment. The scripts cover various aspects of access control, including role-based access control (RBAC), discretionary access control (DAC), and privilege management. Additionally, the scripts demonstrate the creation of masking policies and row access policies to protect sensitive data and enforce security restrictions. The branch serves as a reference for implementing robust security measures and managing access permissions within a database system.
